- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind Css
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- In this i'm using display grid for making a grid its helful.
```css
.grid {
 display:grid;
}
```


### Continued development

- While I'm starting to create this design then I created desktop view first after that I created the mobile view by sing media query.
